# Assessing Depth of Anaesthesia using EEG data
Attempting to implement the ideas from the paper "Depth of anaesthesia assessment based on adult
electroencephalograph beta frequency band" by Dr. Tianning Li and Dr. Peng Wen (found here: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13246-016-0459-5) using a publicly available dataset (found here: https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/EEG_and_BIS_raw_data/5589841). 

This is my first attempt at anything related to signal processing or time-series data. I have tried to limit my use of libraries where possible in order to cement my understanding of the employed concepts. 

Graphs displaying the coefficient of determination for each extracted feature for each frequency band can be found in the Graphs folder. The x-axis of the graphs represents the frequency bands defined in fft.py with indices 1-20 representing the amplitude of these frequency bands and indices 21-40 representing the power.

The correlation values produced were poor. Following a thorough review for bugs, checks to see if the data can be denoised any further, and resampling of the data to ensure a even distribution of anaesthetic states, all without improvement in the correlation values, I can only conclude that the results of the paper cannot be reproduced using this particular data set.
